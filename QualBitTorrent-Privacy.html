    <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
    <p> I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an
        error in the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone
        called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
        device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
        the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

    <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
    <p> I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>

        <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
        <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your
        Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they
        are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
    <p> I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving
        to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over
        the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee
        its absolute security.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Foreground service</strong></p>
    <p> The app uses a foreground service to manage file downloads, ensuring tasks are completed
        even when the app is minimized or the screen is off. This improves user experience by preventing interruptions
        in long-running operations.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Notifications</strong></p>
    <p>This app may request notification permission to inform users about download progress or completion. We do not use
        notifications for advertising or tracking purposes.</p>

    <p><strong>Storage Access</strong></p>
    <p>This app may request access to storage for the purpose of saving downloaded videos to your device. We do not
        access, collect, or upload any files outside those created or selected by the user.</p>

        this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting
