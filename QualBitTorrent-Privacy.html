    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p> Sai Labs built the Qual BitTorrent app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Sai Labs at no cost and is
        intended for use as is.
    </p>
    <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and
        disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
    </p>
    <p>If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation
        to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the
        Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described
        in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible
        at Qual BitTorrent unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
    <p>
        I do not collect any personally identifiable information from users.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.
    </p>

        <p>Link to the privacy policies of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>

    <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
    <p> I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an
        error in the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone
        called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
        device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
        the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
    <p> I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
        <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
        <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
        <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your
        Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they
        are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
    <p> I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving
        to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over
        the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee
        its absolute security.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Foreground service</strong></p>
    <p> The app uses a foreground service to manage file downloads, ensuring tasks are completed
        even when the app is minimized or the screen is off. This improves user experience by preventing interruptions
        in long-running operations.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Notifications</strong></p>
    <p>This app may request notification permission to inform users about download progress or completion. We do not use
        notifications for advertising or tracking purposes.</p>

    <p><strong>Storage Access</strong></p>
    <p>This app may request access to storage for the purpose of saving downloaded videos to your device. We do not
        access, collect, or upload any files outside those created or selected by the user.</p>

    <p><strong>Device permissions for Personal Data access</strong></p>
    <p>Depending on the User’s specific device, Qual BitTorrent may request certain permissions to access the User’s device data, as outlined below.
        By default, these permissions must be explicitly granted by the User before any associated information can be accessed. Once granted, permissions can be revoked by the User at any time. To do so, Users may refer to their device settings or contact the Owner using the contact details provided in this document.
        Please note that the process for managing app permissions may vary depending on the User’s device model and operating system.
        Revoking such permissions may affect the proper functioning of Qual BitTorrent.
        If the User grants any of the permissions listed below, the corresponding Personal Data may be processed by Qual BitTorrent (i.e., accessed, modified, or deleted).
    </p>


    <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
    <p> I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review
        this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting
        the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on
        this page.
